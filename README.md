# vimrc
My vimrc file, use it if you want :)

I'm only new to vim but I plan to use it for writing Python and R code.

Some ideas were taken from the excellent RealPython article about vim which can be found here[https://realpython.com/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/]

Mostly i want it to execute python and R code line by line which it does. and to provide intellisense like completion, which it almost does with ALE.
